<h1 id="about-the-nationalmap">About the NationalMap</h1>
<p>The <strong>NationalMap</strong> is a website for map-based access to spatial data from Australian government agencies. It is an initiative of the Department of Communications and the Arts now currently managed by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the software has been developed by Data61 working closely with the Department of Communications and the Arts, Geoscience Australia and other government agencies.</p>

<p>The <strong>NationalMap</strong> is a fully open architecture. When you access data through it, you are typically accessing the data directly from the government department or agency which is the custodian of that data.</p>
<p>The <strong>NationalMap</strong>...</p>
<ul>
<li>provides easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and the public</li>
<li>facilitates the opening of data by federal, state and local government bodies</li>
<li>provides an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation</li>
</ul>
<p>To see what data is available on the NationalMap, refer to the Data Catalogue in the <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/" >NationalMap</a> itself. Click the <strong>Data Catalogue</strong> tab and expand the Data Set group names.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-the-nationalmap">How to use the NationalMap</h2>
<p>Just go to <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/" >http://nationalmap.gov.au/</a>. Most operations are obvious, but you can click the <a href="help/help.html" >Help and FAQs</a> button near the top of this page for specific instructions.</p>
<p>For further information email <a href="mailto:data@pmc.gov.au" >data@pmc.gov.au</a>. Feel free to send us feedback and bug reports.</p>
<h2 id="contributing-data-to-nationalmap">Contributing Data to NationalMap</h2>
<p>Spatial data sets which are placed on <a href="http://data.gov.au/" >data.gov.au</a> using supported data formats and protocols (such as WMS) will automatically be included in the NationalMap. See the <a href="help/help.html" >How To...</a> page for more information.</p>
<p>Australian government agencies that wish to find out more information about contributing data sets to the NationalMap should email <a href="mailto:data@pmc.gov.au" >data@pmc.gov.au</a> with their questions. Typically, the NationalMap does not store the data itself, but refers to the data servers of the data contributors, directly taking that data and presenting it overlaid over a map. Therefore, agencies providing data directly must have the data available via an online server using a standard protocol.</p>
<h2 id="nationalmap-software">NationalMap Software</h2>
<p>The NationalMap is Open Source software available as a <a href="https://github.com/NICTA/nationalmap" >Github project</a>. The core platform, <a href="https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs" >TerriaJS</a>, was initially developed by Data61 for the NationalMap, but has subsequently been used for other projects. It has been made available to assist with the development of other spatial data viewing applications.</p>
